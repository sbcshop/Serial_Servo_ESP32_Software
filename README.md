The ESP32 S3 based Serial Servo Board is designed for precise control of up to 253 Serial Bus Servos. It features built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. Ideal choice for ESP32 based community interested to build robotics projects like hexapod walkers and robotic arms, its compact design ensures compatibility with space-constrained projects.

This Github provides getting started guide for Serial Servo based on ESP32.
